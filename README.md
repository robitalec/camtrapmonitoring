## Name

This package was previously named {wildcam} but renamed to
{camtrapmonitoring} to reflect broadened scope of package from planning
camera trap surveys to community based monitoring of wildlife and
density estimation, and to avoid confusion with other projects using
camera traps named wildcam or similar.
